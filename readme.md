## Jedi Master Bot

An advanced hello world using the Microsoft Bot Framework.

## What is this bot?

This bot uses the Microsoft Bot Framework and the cognitive services of Azure known as [Luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai/). This bot knows information about almost every character in the Star Wars universe. This knowledge comes from the open API called [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/).

## Using and developing this bot

1. Download and install the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) and [botframework-emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com/)
1. Make the clone of this project
1. Install the dependencies with the `npm install` command
1. Run the bot with the `npm start` command 

*This project was based on the hello world of the Marathon Bots created by Microsoft. I'm adapting the project to be more "open" and can be run in any environment using Node.JS.*
